## .net 8 NativeAOT problem
It seems that the more commonly used MessagePack library has an issue with List<T> when publishing with NativeAOT.

I came across the Nerdbank alternative, which reportedly doesn't have this problem.

However, I noticed that publish times were significantly longer and the file sizes much larger when using Nerdbank.

While the program works fine, Iâ€™m hesitant to switch to Nerdbank for now due to these concerns.

## Test
Run powershell script `publish_and_compare.ps1` to compare the results.

## Sizes
| Project           | File                  | Size (MB) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| MessagePackCSharp | MessagePackCSharp.exe | 5.17      |
| MessagePackCSharp | MessagePackCSharp.pdb | 27.46     |
| Nerdbank          | Nerdbank.exe          | 30.22     |
| Nerdbank          | Nerdbank.pdb          | 370.65    |

## Publish times
| Project           | Time (s) |
|-------------------|----------|
| MessagePackCSharp | 8.7      |
| Nerdbank          | 32.0     |
